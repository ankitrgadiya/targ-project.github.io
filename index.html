      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Targ is the project for documentation and guides of open source
        softwares and programming. This project is still in its initial
        phase and still taking shape. The project is inspired by the
        <a href="http://tldp.org">TLDP</a> or The Linux Documentation Project.
        This is a gesture to continue the documenting open source and keep it
        alive. Documentation is often considered very boring part of
        programming but is quite necessary so that people other then
        developers themselves can use the software easily.
